This file contains a hint about how to solve the problem.
I suggest you don't look at it unless you've tried and 
failed to solve it, and you feel like you need some help.

To ensure you don't unintentionally read the hint, it's right at the bottom of this file - so you need to scroll down to see it.



















































































































The hint is: TryUpdate() will update the value in a thread-safe way, but it carries the risk of failing. But if it does fail, there's no reason why you shouldn't try again until it does succeed.
